=======================================================
cmd2 is a tool for building interactive Python command line applications. Your goal is to make it
quick and easy for developers to create a feature-rich, easy-to-use interactive command line
assisting the pentest in creating their tools. It provides a simple API that is an extension of Python built-in, its first version and based on cmd2 version 1.0 as the author of this project I leave the credits to those responsible for the project in its first version
[cmd](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html) module.  cmd2 provides a wealth of features on top
of cmd to make your life easier and eliminates much of the boilerplate code which would be necessary
when using cmd.
